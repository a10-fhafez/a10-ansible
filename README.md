# a10-ansible

A10 Networks Inc. Application Delivery Controller (ADC) Ansible Scripts

The scripts in this repository are intended to work on ACOS 2.7.x (aXAPI 2.1) and ACOS 4.1.0 (aXAPI 3.0)
They have been tested to work on 2.7.2-P4 and 4.1.0-P9 build 60

Any playbook or module which has a name ending in _2 or _v2 is designed to work on aXAPI 2.1.
Any playbook or module which has a name ending in _3 or _v3 is designed to work on aXAPI 3.0.

Please note: I realize there is an A10 Ansible Repository out there but I didn't want to clobber anyone elses work until this is ready.

This will eventually get merged into the A10 Ansible Repository and posted on Redhat's Ansible website.
